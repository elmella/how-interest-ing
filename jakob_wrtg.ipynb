    "### Research Question Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important and influential indicators of the United States economy is the federal funds rate, often referred to colloquially as the interest rate. The federal funds rate is a target interest rate set by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in an attempt to control other key economic indicators. The Federal Reserve seeks to reach its target interest rate by setting a discount rate (the cost banks face to borrow money from other banks in order to meet overnight reserve requirements), engaging in open market operations (reducing or increasing the quantity of U.S. treasury bills available for purchase), and adjusting reserve requirement (the percentage of money banks must keep in reserve rather than lending it to clients) (#1). In practice, the federal funds rate truly does prevail as the standard interest rate throughout the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fed has a mandate to promote \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\" (#2). Although this list contains three goals, it is commonly referred to as the \"dual mandate\", which can alternatively be summarized by the goal for maximum employment and low, stable inflation (#2). Significantly, an increase or decrease in the federal funds rate impacts levels of personal consumption and spending as well as corporate investment. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing money, which allows us to think of interest rates as the price of money. For example, when interest rates are relatively high, consumers have greater incentive to save money (and earn interest) rather than spending, while companies have less incentive to invest (since they must borrow at a higher rate to do so). This leads to an overall cooling in the economy. Conversely, lower interest rates increase personal consumption and corporate investment, which stimulates the economy. Cumulatively, these personal and corporate decisions, all based on the federal funds rate, have direct and dramatic effects on important economic indicators such as inflation, real GDP, mortgage rates, and unemployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the federal funds rate influences so many economic outcomes, foreknowledge of changes in the federal funds rate would allow consumers, producers, and investment managers to time and allocate their resources effectively. Of particular interest to our group is how changes in the federal funds rate affect the performance of institutional investors' bond portfolios. There is an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices; higher interest rates lead to lower prices (#3). Thus, bond portfolios can get burned by a rapid increase in rates, leading to a painful dip in returns (#3). Even equity portfolios can be negatively impacted by higher rates. As companies have less incentive to borrow money for spending on new projects, the higher rates often lead to lower profits, and thus lower stock prices. For this reason, much effort is expended to predict the target federal funds rate, which is determined roughly every six weeks by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the policy-making team of the Federal Reserve (#4). The FOMC has shared some indicators that it considers in its decisions, including various price indices and labor market indicators, such as the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (#5). However, it does not explicitly share the way it considers or weights these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many predictive bodies, such as the Blue Chip consensus, are relatively successful at predicting changes in the federal funds rate when most or all economic indicators are positive (or negative), but are inconsistent in accuracy when economic conditions are mixed (#6). Their historical accuracy and prediction methods are unclear. As a proxy for their accuracy, we use as a benchmark for the success of our methods as the naive method of predicting that each meeting, the Fed will choose to hold interest rates constant. Using the techniques of regression and classification, we seek to appropriately select critical features from available economic indicators in order to develop a robust model for predicting changes in the federal funds rate. In particular, we concern ourselves with finding features that best predict FOMC decisions to raise, lower, or hold constant the target federal funds rate. Throughout this project, we seek to answer three key questions: 1) What features have the most predictive power for forecasting FOMC decisions? 2) What regression and classification methods are best suited to forecasting these decisions? 3) How accurately can we predict FOMC decisions?"

    "In our search for data on key economic indicators that might influence the federal funds rate, we looked to the St. Louis Federal Reserve (FRED) website. This site hosts an enormous amount of time series data on economic indicators that have been tracked carefully and methodically for years. In selecting features, we focused on features with data continuously tracked since 1989 (the first year for which FOMC federal funds rate decisions are available) to the present day. We also chose features that we felt were most likely to have predictive power in determining the FOMC's decision to raise or lower interest rate. With these two considerations in mind, we selected the prime loan interst rate, exports, personal consumption, unemployment rate, GDP, vehicle sales, cash flows, housing starts, and a composite indicator, as well as a categorical variable for recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, since we hypothesized that stock market values and the strength of the dollar might be important factors in the FOMC's decision, we took daily reports of the S&P 500 closing price and US Dollar index for the relevant time period (as reported on Yahoo Finance) and appended these features to our dataset. We also generated categorical features for political party of the Fed chair and political party of the U.S. president.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our search for data on the dependent variables of interest--the federal funds rate, its percentage point change at each announcement, and the direction of change--led us to a dataset provided by Dr. Kuttner, professor of economics at Williams University, containing recorded values of these variables from 1989 to 2019. We built upon this dataset, using FOMC announcement archives from 2019 to the present to complete the set."

FRED data is easily pulled using their API by entering a specific data series identifier. The data we chose from FRED all spanned the entire period of interest (1989-2023). A few data series, such as nonfarm job openings, are reportedly important to the FOMC when setting interest rates. However, given they didn't span the entire time period of our interest rate data, we chose to exclude these variables. This is a limitation to our classification attempts, but attempting to fill in macroeconomic variables is far beyond the scope of this project. Furthermore, we are confident that the other features we selected have high explanatory power for FOMC decisions, which gave us solace in not including the few economic indicators with insufficient history."

    "The data cleaning and feature engineering code found above is flexible and simple to modify. One can easily add not only new features but also recent FOMC decisions. Adding new data series from FRED and Yahoo! Finance is the easiest modification. Simply add the identifying name of the feature as well as the series code for FRED or the ticker for Yahoo! Finance, and the for loops will handle the rest. Adding data from outside CSV files only requires adding the name of the new dataframe to the list when creating `df_features`. Thus, any number of new features (columns) from a variety of sources can be quickly added. By virtue of the `ffill()` function, any data pulled using the FRED or Yahoo! Finance API is properly extended to the last row of the dataframe, which corresponds to the most recent FOMC announcement we have data for.\n",
    "\n",
    "New FOMC announcement data can be appended by modifying the ffr_clean.csv file. This is done by adding the new target Fed Funds Rate under the `ffr` column and the change in basis points under the `change` column. In addition, the `scheduled` column should be entered as 1 if the meeting was scheduled and 0 if it was a surprise. The columns `decision` and `mom` are calculated automatically. It is critical to note that new FOMC announcements should be added sequentially and even if the meeting was unscheduled in order to keep the data consistent. Modifying this data is more of a hassle than adding new features, but meetings generally only occur every six weeks and require the addition of only three data points to the CSV file. All things considered, this is an insignificant burden to adding more data points. In addition, when new data points are added, the data coming from FRED and Yahoo! Finance automatically pull from 1989 until the present day. It is the responsibility of the researcher to ensure any data coming from CSV files is still accurate when adding new FOMC announcement data, as this will not automatically refresh, but autofill from the most recent valid entry using the `ffill()` function."
